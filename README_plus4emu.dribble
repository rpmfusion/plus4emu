README for plus4emu
===================

1. The ROMs are not distributed with the rpm, however as stated in the plus4emu
documentation, the ROMs can be obtained from:

http://www.sharemation.com/IstvanV/roms/plus4emu_roms.zip

2. Unless you have configured plus4emu to look elsewhere, then the roms should
be installed into the "$HOME/.plus4emu/roms" directory. You may also need to
run the "plus4emu-makecfg" command after the rom installation in order to
plus4emu to recognise them.
